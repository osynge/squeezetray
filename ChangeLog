    The code has changed dramaticlly. Much more professional but sadly much more bulky and lots to clean up.
    Now we have the thread pool not just taking requests from a thread safe queue and executing them but 
    also storing the result in a thread safe thread pool and passing the message to wx GUI thread. This is 
    The same model I intend for Android.

prerelease 

    I changed the code to be more and more Model, View, Controller Pattern.
    The model is updated from the server using json http, using a view as a thread pool.
    Callbacks on changes to the model to the Controller can then trigger further things.

    In this case another View is triggered to display the model as the StatusBar and Tooltip, 
    which shows details about the current track playing, and server status.
